# Contribute

**_This is Work in Progress_**

These are some recommendations if you want to contribute:

1. Clone the [master](link to master) branch of the repository.
2. Set up the project according to this [guide](PROJECT_SETUP.md)
3. Make sure all [tests are passing](PROJECT_SETUP.md#testing-the-plugin)
4. Write tests for your new functionality. There are plenty of examples in the [test](hehe) folder
5. Do some manual testing before submitting the pull request. Check [this](PROJECT_SETUP.md#testing-the-plugin) for run configurations for manual testing
